# OctoAcme — Retrospective & Continuous Improvement

## Purpose
Capture learnings and convert them into actionable improvements.

## When
After each sprint, release, or important milestone. Also after incidents.

## Structure
- What went well
- What could be improved
- Action items (owner, due date)
- Follow-up on previous action items

## Running a Retrospective
- Timebox: 45–75 minutes depending on team size
- Use an anonymous idea board if needed to encourage candor
- Prioritize 2–3 top action items to avoid overload
- Consider role-specific prompts:
  - **UX**: Did we validate designs with users? Were accessibility requirements met?
  - **DevOps**: Were deployments smooth? Did monitoring catch issues proactively?
  - **Documentation**: Was documentation kept current? Did users find what they needed?
  - **Support**: Were we prepared for post-release support? What trends emerged from tickets?
  - **Development**: Did our code quality meet standards? Were technical risks managed?
  - **Product/Project**: Were priorities clear? Did we deliver expected value?

## Tracking Improvements
- Add action items to the project backlog or issues with clear owners and timelines
- Review outstanding actions in the weekly PM sync

## Continuous Improvement Culture
- Measure impact of action items
- Celebrate improvements and make small, iterative changes
