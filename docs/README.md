# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

## Summary

OctoAcme's project management approach emphasizes customer-first value delivery, iterative increments, clear ownership, data-informed decisions, and psychological safety. The lifecycle follows five core stages: Initiation (validate need and stakeholders), Planning (define scope and backlog), Execution & Tracking (build and monitor), Release & Deployment (ship and verify), and Retrospective & Improvement (capture learnings). These docs guide teams through each phase to ensure predictable, high-quality delivery.

## Quick Start for New Contributors

1. **Read the Overview**: Start with [octoacme-project-management-overview.md](./octoacme-project-management-overview.md) to understand our core principles and lifecycle.
2. **Review Initiation**: Check [octoacme-project-initiation.md](./octoacme-project-initiation.md) to learn how projects are validated and authorized.
3. **Scan Planning & Execution**: Review [octoacme-project-planning.md](./octoacme-project-planning.md) and [octoacme-execution-and-tracking.md](./octoacme-execution-and-tracking.md) for backlog management and daily workflows.
4. **Check Release Guide**: See [octoacme-release-and-deployment.md](./octoacme-release-and-deployment.md) for deployment standards.
5. **Understand Retrospectives**: Read [octoacme-retrospective-and-continuous-improvement.md](./octoacme-retrospective-and-continuous-improvement.md) to learn how we continuously improve.

## Lifecycle Overview

1. **Initiation**: Validate business need, identify stakeholders, and create a project one-pager with success metrics.
2. **Planning**: Break work into shippable increments, estimate scope, define Definition of Done, and create a release plan.
3. **Execution & Tracking**: Build features iteratively, track progress on project boards, and manage blockers with daily standups.
4. **Release & Deployment**: Deploy to production following pre-release checklists, smoke tests, and rollback plans.
5. **Retrospective & Improvement**: Capture learnings, prioritize action items, and iterate on processes.
